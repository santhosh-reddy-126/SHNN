# SHNN Project

This repository contains resources and code for the **SHNN (Self-Healing Neural Network)** project. The project focuses on analyzing the robustness of neural networks under different types of structural damages and evaluating healing techniques to restore performance.

### Dataset Details

1. **Numbers MNIST**  
   - Standard MNIST dataset of handwritten digits (0â€“9).  
   - Used for evaluating SHNN on simple numeric classification tasks.  

2. **Sign Language MNIST**  
   - MNIST-style dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs.  
   - Used for testing SHNN on gesture recognition tasks.  

3. **Fashion MNIST**  
   - MNIST-style dataset of fashion products (clothing, shoes, etc.).  
   - Used for evaluating SHNN performance on more complex, real-world image classification tasks.
